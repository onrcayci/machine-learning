# Machine Learning Practices

This repository includes my machine learning practice on the Google Colab platform. There are 4 major projects that are included in this repository:

1. KNN and Decision Tree classifiers
<!-- 2. Naive Bayes, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression classifiers
3. Multi-Layer Perceptron with varying hidden layers
4. Reproduction of the CapsNet Research Paper results -->

## [KNN and Decision Tree classifiers](classifiers/classifiers.ipynb)

The first project focuses on implementing the KNN and Decision Tree classifiers from scratch. These two classifiers are implemented only using NumPy and as a class. Following the implementation, several experiments are run in order to observe the accuracy of the classifiers. The datasets that are used for these experiments are [breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv](classifiers/breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv) and [hepatitis.csv](classifiers/hepatitis.csv). These experiments include various runs with different hyperparameters, hyperparameter tuning and decision boundary visualization.
